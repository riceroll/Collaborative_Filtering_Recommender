# Collaborative_Filtering_Recommender
Recommend academic articles with item-to-item collaborative filtering

## Introduction
Use item-to-item collaborative filtering to recommend papers according to a rating matrix, which can be generated by reference relationship, [content-based recommender](https://github.com/riceroll/Content_Based_Recommender/blob/master/README.md) or [CNN for Text](https://github.com/riceroll/TextCNN_Based_Feature_Extraction).

### Dataset
